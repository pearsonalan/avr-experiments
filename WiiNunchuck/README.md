# WiiNunchuck

An experiment in talking to a Wii Nunchuck controller using the
arduino.

Initially, this project is simply the Arduino/Nunchuck interface
written by Chad Phillips and originally posted at

I've taken the code he posted on his blog and updated it to work with
the Arduino 1.6.7 platform.  Also, since he mentioned that he needed
to make modifications to the included TWI library, I have included
the files for the TWI library here with the needed modifications.
